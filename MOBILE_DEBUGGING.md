# Mobile Debugging Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mobile Loading Problems
- **Added viewport meta tag** in `layout.tsx` for proper mobile scaling
- **Changed `min-h-screen` to `min-h-[100dvh]`** on mobile for better viewport handling
- **Added `overflow-x: hidden`** to body to prevent horizontal scroll issues
- **Optimized hero background** with better mobile scaling

### 2. Preload Warnings
- **Disabled automatic font preloading** to prevent unused preload warnings
- **Added `loading="eager"`** to hero image for faster mobile loading
- **Reduced font weights** loaded to minimize unused resources

## Testing on Mobile

1. **Chrome DevTools Mobile Simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   # Click device toolbar icon or Ctrl+Shift+M
   # Select iPhone or Android device
   # Refresh the page
   ```

2. **Real Device Testing:**
   - Ensure your phone and computer are on the same network
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Note the Network URL (e.g., `http://192.168.0.104:3001`)
   - Open that URL on your phone

3. **Common Mobile Issues to Check:**
   - Page loads without horizontal scrolling
   - Text is readable without zooming
   - Touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Images load properly
   - Forms are usable

## Performance Monitoring

Check for remaining preload warnings in browser console:
- Open DevTools â†’ Console
- Look for "resource was preloaded but not used" warnings
- If any remain, they may be from third-party scripts or unused Next.js optimizations

## Quick Mobile Test

Test these key interactions on mobile:
1. Page loads completely
2. Hero section displays properly
3. Navigation menu works
4. Contact form is usable
5. Phone number links work (will try to dial)
